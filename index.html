                <p class="Author">Edyoda <span class="date"> | 18 Jul 2023</span> </p> 
                <p>We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.</p>

                <p>If you learn cloud computing then you can make things much easier for your projects. You do not have to rely on multiple hard drives or data storage devices for with cloud computing you can store all your important data on a remote database. To put it simply cloud computing offers the delivery of different services through the internet. These services include tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. For a more efficient and smooth workflow, cloud computing surely seems to be taking over, and more and more people are moving to use it to the best of its services. Here’s all you need to know about it.</p>

                <p class="blog-content">Big data is the phrase that is used to define large structured and unstructured volumes of data that has the potential to be mined for information and used in machine learning projects and other advanced analytics applications. According to the big data management, the quality of the data should be high and there should be accessibility for business intelligence. This information benefits corporations, government agencies, and other agencies to develop strategies to help them cope up with the fast-growing amount of data, typically involving the large size of data saved in many file formats. Therefore, it is recommended to learn big Data online courses from EdYoda -  A free technology learning and knowledge-sharing platform.</p>

                    <p>When computers were standalone devices, security was a minimal concern. Mainframes had their own protected facilities. Slowly and steadily as computing became more personal, security became the personal responsibility too. The use of computers increasingly involves networks of computers for messaging, on-line transactions, remote hosting. It started including the opportunities for the attack which have multiplied exponentially. Arriving at the security part became a major concern to drive out businesses well and generate revenues without leading to the losses due to the breach of security</p>

                    <p class="Author">Edyoda <span class="date"> | 18 Jul 2023</span> </p> 
                    <p>A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a positive change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is necessary for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time. 

                        Before moving forward, let us understand the concept of Data Backup and Recovery.
                        
                        Backup is the process of creating and storing copies of data that is confidential to the organization against the data loss or in case of emergency. Recovery is the process that involves restoring the lost data to the original location or another location. It is essential to have a proper backup copy in a separate system. It is the duty of every employee to keep the data structured and backed up in a separate storage device and not to hand it over to somebody else as it has confidential information.</p>

                    <p class="Author">Edyoda <span class="date"> | 18 Jul 2023</span> </p> 
                    <p class="blog-content">The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced by Milton Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college graduates.

                        So, what is this Income Share Agreement?
                        
                        As defined in Wikipedia: 
                        
                        “An  income share agreement  (or  ISA) is a financial structure in which an individual or organization provides something of value (often a fixed amount of money) to a recipient who, in exchange, agrees to pay back a percentage of their income for a fixed number of years.”
                        
                        Too much jargon? Let’s simplify the context.</p>
